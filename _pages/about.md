üëãHello! I am currently a first-year PhD student in [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yunduan Cui](https://cuiyunduan.notion.site/Yunduan-Cui-1f47f8077204807c8abcf89bad523bae).

Prior to this, I received Master of Electronic and Information Engineering in Computer Technology from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2025.

My research interests lie in the reinforcement learning and robot learning, especially in complex systems, like USV system, HVAC system, chemical production control etc.

In addition to academic, My areas of expertise include but are not limited to **full-stack software and hardware development**, **cybersecurity maintenance**, patent writing, commercial product design, and business plan writing. For more about me, visit my [blog](https://mrjun.cn).
